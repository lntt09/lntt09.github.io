4. A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Welcome to Your Pokédex. My name is Tiffany and let me help you find more about these magical Pokémons so that you can select your own team. 

#My Approach
As a Pokémon trainer, how do you select your team without knowing the Pokémon's capabilties? Well that issue is now resolved! With a Pokédex in hand, you are able to search for each Pokémon by name to find out what skills they have.

#My Development
Alot of the data that is being displayed on the page is going through an AJAX call to the PokéAPI. From there, I am using jquery to append the data to the page. Through research, I've found some unique methods to curve the edges of divs to give the game console a more "original" look. 

#UnSolved Problems & Additional add-ons I would like to do
- I need to resolve the issue when adding the Pokémon to the Team, it is only appending the very first Pokémon you select over and over again. I think the problem is me not looping through and displaying each item in the array. 
- I would like to get user input on their name, and append it to the top of the page where "My Pokémon Pokédex belongs so that the user feels that this is more personal.
- Graphicly, I would like to add more buttons to make the console look more realistic.
